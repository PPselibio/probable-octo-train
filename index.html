  <h2>Church of Santo Tomas de Villanueva – Miag-ao, Iloilo</h2>
  <p>
  One of the UNESCO Heritage Sites in the Philippines is the church of Santo Tomas de Villanueva in Miag-ao. It is among the best examples of the “fortress baroque” style in the country.

  <h2>Paoay Church (Church of San Agustin) – Paoay, Ilocos Norte</h2>
  <p>
  Church of San Agustin or Paoay Church is known for its extravagant coral-block buttresses and ornate stone finials. Its construction began in 1604 and was completed in 1710.

For your information, Philippine bell towers were constructed at a distance from the main church structure to avoid its falling on the church during earthquakes.  </p>

  <h2>Historic City of Vigan</h2>
  <p>
  Established in the 16th century, Vigan is the best-preserved example of a planned Spanish colonial town in Asia according to UNESCO. One of the reasons for its inclusions in the cultural heritage sites in the Philippines is that its architecture reflects the coming together of cultural elements from elsewhere in the Philippines, from China and from Europe, resulting in a culture and townscape that have no parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia. </p>
